In experiment 2, we test the hypothesis that deepfakes may alter
political attitudes even when they do not deceive, through a political
affect prime. To test this hypothesis, we exploit recordings from
Saturday Night Live, in which candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders
were mocked by cast members, who appeared as Biden and Sanders in
otherwise realistic settings.\footnote{Specifically, we extract clips
  from this skit:

In the control, subjects are assigned to the original recording, where
the candidate is clearly portrayed by an actor on SNL. In the
treatment, subjects are exposed to a deepfake in which the true
candidate's face is transfered on to the actor's. The only manipulated
component of the clip is the actor's face.

As in experiment 1, subjects are asked questions P1, P2, and P3 before
and after the experiment. We estimate the effect of a face transfer
deepfake after with the difference in differences.
