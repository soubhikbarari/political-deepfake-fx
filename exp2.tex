\subsection{Affect Manipulation Experiment (Stage 1b)}



The idea here is that we show them video clips of Biden and Bernie
from SNL: specifically clips that elicit laughter + mock them rather
than make them look awesome / appealing [though we do have clips of
  those also!]. In case, the clips mock them for their age / Biden for
touchy-feeliness.

Biden control video (URL of specific clip)
Bernie control video (URL of specific clip)
Biden face transfer
Bernie face transfer

[I’m thinking we ask the same battery as Stage 1a? The main thing here is capturing affect / “is person X fit for president?”] 
3.3. Choice Task Experiment Experiment (Stage 2)

In this second stage, people are given instructions to identify which
of X videos are deepfakes and which are real.
