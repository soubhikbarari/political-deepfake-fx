Exposure to deepfakes may informationally deceive viewers, depress their trust in all video media, or if, a particularly arousing performance is generated, prime their attitudes towards particular politicians. We present a few hypotheses on the relative magnitude of these effects across important dimensions:

[these are informally written, feel free to edit / add on]

- The overall rate of deception from exposure to deepfakes will be low amongst all possible viewers. The viewerâ€™s digital literacy will negatively mediate their deception.

- Reported distrust in information will be high for viewers who are able to identify that they are viewing a deepfake upon exposure. 

- People who recognize the candidate in the AARP video experiment will be less likely to be deceived by the deepfake itself 

- High political knowledge viewers in the AARP video experiment will be less likely to update their beliefs 

- Out-partisan viewers will more negatively evaluate a candidate after seeing them in the face transfer condition in the SNL experiment (but they will also negatively evaluate them in baseline)
