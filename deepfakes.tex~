CESS Abstract 

0. Crowdsourced Feedback (Not Incorporated into Current Draft)

Ryan Enos (on slide deck):
- If the take is that deepfakes are bad for democracy, you need to think of other important measures that could either prove or falsify this claim 
- Make sure you clarify to the reader that you’re measuring first-order (affect, deception, evaluation, knowledge) in the first stage of this experiment and not second-order things (distrust in news, distrust of politics)

Matt Baum (convo about slide deck):
- We got in a lot of trouble with reviewers for not “controlling” videos carefully -- e.g. videos in different conditions were not of comparable length or quality

Ariel White (on first shared draft):
- People might just throw their hands up and say “truth is subjective” so think carefully about questions like “did you think that what you saw was real?”
- From your earlier draft it was unclear whether we think a world of “deepfakes might exist” vs a world of “deepfakes do exist, here’s one” is more important to simulate / measure.
- The debrief itself is a useful treatment in trust / their ability to id deepfakes
- “I was interested in whether video is more effective vs. article”
