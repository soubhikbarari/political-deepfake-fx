These experiments pose obvious ethical concerns. We will extensively
debrief subjects upon completion of the survey, including extensive
explanation of deefpakes. If subjects saw a video that misrepresented
a candidate's position, they are told the candidate's true position.

It is our hope that participation in the survey educates and informs
study participants, in exchange for temporary deceipt.
