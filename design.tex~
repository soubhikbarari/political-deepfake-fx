We recruit 5,000 online survey respondents from Lucid. We measure the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item party id
\item age
\item gender
\item digital literacy
\end{itemize}

There are two possible experiments at the first stage (issue position manipulation/AARP video or affect manipulation/SNL video). This is followed by a choice-task experiment in the second stage.

\subsection{Issue Position Manipulation Experiment (Stage 1a)}

This experiment will consist of watching an AARP voter guide video of one of the 2020 primary candidates being asked about their position on a particular issue. We selected a question regarding healthcare expansion since there is variation on the types of issue positions amongst the candidates. In particular we select responses to the question:


“How would you update and strengthen Medicare and Social Security to keep them strong for future generations?”

 Upon recruitment into our experiment, we assign each respondent to one of 10 treatment conditions (focusing on white male candidates to control for speaker race/gender):

Control Video (show the segment of the AARP video starting with question+music, the response, and then fade to black): 
Liberal Democrat (Sanders) true response to question:
“Well as the founder of the defending Social Security caucus the answer to that question is pretty easy, we scrap the cap and what we do is make sure we end the absurdity of somebody making millions of dollars a year today paying exactly the same amount into the Social Security trust fund as somebody making a hundred and thirty two thousand nine hundred dollars and when you do that you can, A, expand benefits for lower-income seniors many of whom are struggling on inadequate Social Security benefits and number two we extend the life of Social Security for our kids and our grandchildren by 52 years. That's what we have to do.”
Moderate Democrat (Biden) true response to question:
“I would make sure the people making over $400,000 pay the exact same percentage for both Medicare and Social Security that are paid for people making up to $125,000 that will raise billions of dollars over time there'd be a doughnut hole between 125 and 400 but everybody above that they would have to pay the same percentage in both areas, both Medicare and Social Security, and would increase the solvency exponentially.”
Control Text (vignette):
When asked by AARP advocacy group what is your position on X, presidential candidate Bernie Sanders responded: X
When asked by AARP advocacy group what is your position on X, presidential candidate Joe Biden responded: X

Treatment Video:
Liberal Democrat (Sanders) fake conservative statement
Well as the founder of the defending Social Security caucus, I have to be honest with the American people: it is a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old today, "you’re paying into a program that’s going to be there”. Anybody that’s for the status quo with Social Security today is telling a monstrous lie to our kids, and it’s not right. That’s why I’m calling to overhaul Social Security and replace it with a commonsense market-based approach.

That will raise billions of dollars over time and increase the solvency exponentially. And as the country that spends the most in the developed world on bureaucracy relative to patient care, we should absolutely be guaranteeing universal healthcare and that's why I strongly endorse Medicare-for-All.”

Before showing them the video, we ask the following baseline:

B1: How much do you trust your online news sources?
Strongly trust
Moderately trust
Kinda distrust
Strongly distrust
B2a: How do you feel about candidate X? 
Strongly like 
Moderately like
Kinda like
Dislike(?)
Strongly dislike
	B2b: Rate how fit you think candidate X is to be president from a scale of Y-Z
B3: What do you think candidate X's position on updating Medicare / Social Security is?
B4: What are your views on Social Security?
B5: What are your views on Medicare?
After the video, we ask the following endline:
E1: What are your views on Social Security?
E2: What are your views on Medicare?
E3: What do you think candidate X's position on updating Medicare / Social Security is?
E4a: How do you feel about candidate X?
E4b: Rate how fit you think candidate X is to be president from a scale of Y-Z
E5: How much do you trust your news sources?
E6: Did you think the video that you saw was real?
We follow up with a strong debrief for individuals exposed to the deepfake treatment. 


\subsection{Affect Manipulation Experiment (Stage 1b)}
The idea here is that we show them video clips of Biden and Bernie
from SNL: specifically clips that elicit laughter + mock them rather
than make them look awesome / appealing [though we do have clips of
  those also!]. In case, the clips mock them for their age / Biden for
touchy-feeliness.

[I’m thinking we ask the same battery as Stage 1a? The main thing here is capturing affect / “is person X fit for president?”] 
3.3. Choice Task Experiment Experiment (Stage 2)

In this second stage, people are given instructions to identify which of X videos are deepfakes and which are real.
