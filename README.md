# Political Deepfakes are as Credible as Other Fake Media and (Sometimes) Real Media
## Replication Code
### Authors: Soubhik Barari, Christopher Lucas, and Kevin Munger

This is the replication code repository for the entitled research article (conditionally accepted at *The Journal of Politics*) which can be found [here](https://osf.io/cdfh3/).

Before replicating the analyses, make sure to create a folder `/figures` and `/tables` in the root directory of the repository.

- `deepfake.RData`: R object containing cleaned and anonymized results of three waves of the two survey experiments (**exposure** and **detection**) in `dat`, the raw but anonymized survey results in `dfsurvdat`, and clip-level results of the detection experiment (`*fakes`).

- `cps2018_crosstabs*`: cross-tabs of demographic categories from the U.S. Census's 2018 Current Population Survey used for weighting.

- `01-weight_data.R`: creates population weights for observations in `dat` object in `deepfake.RData` via a simple raking algorithm on 2018 CPS data.

- `02-prereg_analyses.R`: replicates analyses specified in pre-analysis plan; generates outputs in `/table` and `/figure` found in Appendix of article.

- `02.1-prereg_sensitivity.R`: as requested by a reviewer, conduct sensitivity tests for some pre-registered analyses as a robustness check.

- `02.2-prereg_power.R`: as requested by a reviewer, determine whether the observed sample is actually powered (post hoc) to detect the equivalence bounds specified in the paper.

- `02.3-prereg_bounds.R`: as requested by a reviewer, determine sensitivity of pre-registered analyses to differential attrition across treatment conditions by (1) re-weighting treatment conditions to parity and (2) conducting Manski extreme bounds analyses.

- `03-paper_toplines.R`: summarise pre-registered analysis results in a series of topline tables/figures; this replicates figures found in main text of article.

- `04-supplementary_analyses.R`: replicates supplementary/exploratory analyses found in Appendix of article.
