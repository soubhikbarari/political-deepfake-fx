We conduct the first study of the effects of different fake news
videos on political beliefs. To do so, we train fake videos of
candidates for the 2020 Democratic Presidential nomination. We create
deepfakes such that the informational and affective content of the
video is directly manipulated. Subjects participate in either the
information or affective experiments. All subjects participate in an
experiment testing subjects' ability to distinguish authentic and
deepfake videos, which takes place after the completion of the
informational/affective experiments.
